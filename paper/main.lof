\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Illustration that the unimodal assumption (UA) in {\tt ashr}\xspace can produce very different results from existing methods. The figure shows, for a single simulated dataset, the way different methods decompose $p$ values (left) and $z$ scores (right) into a null component (dark blue) and an alternative component (cyan). In the $z$ score space the alternative distribution is placed on the bottom to highlight the differences in its shape among methods. The three existing methods ({\tt qvalue}\xspace , {\tt locfdr}\xspace , {\tt mixfdr}\xspace ) all effectively make the Zero Assumption, which results in a ``hole" in the alternative $z$ score distribution around 0. In contrast the method introduced here ({\tt ashr}\xspace ) makes the Unimodal Assumption -- that the effect sizes, and thus the $z$ scores, have a unimodal distribution about 0 -- which yields a very different decomposition. (In this case the {\tt ashr}\xspace decomposition is closer to the truth: the data were simulated under a model where all of the effects are non-zero, so the ``true" decomposition would make everything cyan.)\relax }}{38}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Simulation illustrating how, for existing FDR methods, poor-precision observations can contaminate signal from good-precision observations. The top panel (a) illustrates that when $p$ values from good-precision observations (left) and from poor-precision observations (center) are combined (right), they produce a distribution of $p$ values with less overall signal - and so, by conventional methods, will give a higher estimated FDR at any given threshold. The bottom panel (b) illustrates this behavior directly for the methods {\tt qvalue}\xspace and {\tt locfdr}\xspace : the $q$-values from {\tt qvalue}\xspace and the $\textit {lfdr}$ estimates from {\tt locfdr}\xspace are higher when applied to all data than when applied to good-precision observations only. In contrast the methods described here ({\tt ashr}\xspace ) produce effectively the same results (here, the lfsr) in the good-precision and combined data analyses.\relax }}{41}

Left panel shows results under our ``default prior" which assumes that effects $\beta _j$ are identically distributed, independent of $s_j$.
